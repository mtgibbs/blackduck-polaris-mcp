    This service provides access to query the issue management services for lists and counts of issue families, managing issue triage as applied to issue families,

    and unifying issue categorization information.


    The issue query engine accepts queries written in the [rsql format](https://github.com/jirutka/rsql-parser), which is

    expressive yet generally easy to write by hand, and has implementations on several different platforms to aid in building

    queries.


    A simple filter for an issue by the issue's source language may look like this:

    `occurrence:language=in=('C','Java')`


    Since rsql reserves some characters in the key name, these can be escaped using URL encoding:

    `type:in-taxon:PCI%20DSS%202018=='6.5.6 High risk vulnerabilities'`


    When constructing filters, it is recommended to use `;` for `and` and `,` for `or` to combine multiple conditions. For example:

    `occurrence:language=='Java';occurrence:severity=='high'` (equivalent to `and`)

    `occurrence:language=='Java',occurrence:severity=='high'` (equivalent to `or`)


    The following keys can be used when querying _occurrences_:

     Notes:
      1. Supported occurrence property keys include: `cwe`, `filename`, `language`, `location`, `severity`, `line-number`, `local-effect`, `base-risk-score`, `solution`, `workaround`, `title`, `description`, 
    `is-rapid`, `checker`, `coverity-events`, `technical-description`, `overall-score`, `version`, `component-id`, `component-version-id`, `component-origin-id`, `vulnerability-source`, 

    `vulnerability-id`, `linked-vulnerability-id`, `component-name`, `component-version-name`, `component-origin-external-namespace`, `component-origin-external-id`, `published-date`,
    `vendor-fix-date`, 

    `last-modified-date`, `disclosure-date`, `minor-version-upgrade-guidance-version-name`, `minor-version-upgrade-guidance-external-id`, `minor-version-upgrade-guidance-critical-count`,

    `minor-version-upgrade-guidance-high-count`, `minor-version-upgrade-guidance-medium-count`, `minor-version-upgrade-guidance-low-count`, `minor-version-upgrade-guidance-unscored-count`,

    `major-version-upgrade-guidance-version-name`, `major-version-upgrade-guidance-external-id`, `major-version-upgrade-guidance-critical-count`, `major-version-upgrade-guidance-high-count`,

    `major-version-upgrade-guidance-medium-count`, `major-version-upgrade-guidance-low-count`, `major-version-upgrade-guidance-unscored-count`.
      2. There are four possible values for `derived:fix-by-status`:
          * `overdue` means that the Fix By date has passed.
          * `due-soon` means that the Fix By date is within the next 7 days.
          * `on-track` means that the Fix By date is more than 7 days away.
          * `not-set` means the the Fix By date has not been set.
          * **Note:** these states are precise to the second - so a Fix By date in 7 days and 1 minute is `on-track` rather than `due-soon` - similarly, a Fix By date 1 minute ago is `overdue` rather than `due-soon`.
      3. A few considerations apply to `special:delta` filter:
          * It is a comparison filter for tests, and it can only compare two tests - the current one as defined by the `testId` parameter, and the immediately preceding test.
          * When the `testId` parameter is not specified, the `latest` test is used instead - this special keyword will map to the last test of each tool in the current context.
            * **Limitation**: If the `latest` keyword maps to multiple tests, it cannot be used with this filter - instead use a specific UUID for the `testId` parameter.
          * Each keyword has a special meaning:
            * `new` is for issue families present only in the current test, but not in the preceding test. This includes both issues found during the test and those found later by asynchronous updates or component editing.
            * `resolved` is for issue families present only in the preceding test, but not in the current test.
            * `common` is for issue families present in both the current test as well as the preceding test.
            * `new-in-test` is for issue families found in the current test that weren't found in the preceding test. This excludes issue families found later by asynchronous updates or component editing.
            * `new-post-test` is for issue families present only in the current test, but not in the preceding test. Only issue families found after the test by asynchronous updates or component editing are returned. 
      4. A few considerations apply to `special:absent-in-branch` and `special:present-in-branch` filters:
          * The two filters must not both be present in the request.
          * When one of them is present:
            * The query parameter `projectId` or `applicationId` should be provided.
            * The query parameter `branchId` can be provided. It must satisfy the below requirements:
              * The branches specified by `branchId` and the `special` filter must not be the same.
              * The branches specified by `branchId` and the `special` filter should not belong to different projects as it is not supported.
            * If the query parameter `branchId` is not provided:
              * If `projectId` is provided, the corresponding project's default branch will be used instead.
              * If `applicationId` is provided, the corresponding application must have only one default branch which will be used instead.
              * The default branch will need to satisfy the same requirements above for `branchId`.

    ### Scoping


    Scoping parameters are used to narrow down the results returned by the API to specific contexts. Not every endpoint supports every scope parameter, and some of these scope parameters are
    mandatory: where not mandatory, sensible defaults are used (as described below)


    The following parameters are used for scoping:


    - `applicationId` (formerly known as portfolioItemId): Results will include only objects found in the application specified by the ID.

    - `projectId` (formerly known as portfolioSubItemId): Results will include only objects found in the project specified by the ID.

    - `branchId`: Results will include only objects found in the branch specified by the ID. 
      - If branchId is not supplied, the result will only include objects found in the default branch (or branches) associated with the project (or application) - unless a testId is provided which implies a specific branch
    - `testId`: The test ID or the keyword latest to further narrow down the query scope. 
      - If the keyword latest is used or no testId is provided, the result will only include objects that were detected in the latest tests (each kind of tool that ran a test has their own 'latest' test).

    ### Pagination


    The API supports pagination to manage large sets of data. The following parameters are used for pagination:


    - `_first`: Specifies the number of items to return from the beginning of the list.

    - `_last`: Specifies the number of items to return from the end of the list.

    - `_cursor`: A cursor value that points to a specific position in the list. This is used to retrieve the next set of items. The API responses for collections provide the appropriate _cursor values
    to use in future requests.


    ## Links

    The _links attribute in the API responses serves as a navigational tool, providing URLs to related objects or pagination links when dealing with paginated endpoints. 


    ## Media Type Changes


    Media type names used in Polaris APIs were renamed and no longer include “synopsys”. 

    Although media types that include “synopsys” were removed from the API specifications, existing endpoints will continue to support them until March 24, 2026. 

    Please update your scripts to use the new media types.


    **Base path change and deprecation notice**


    The base path for the Findings service is changing (from `/api/specialization-layer-service` to `/api/findings`). The `/api/specialization-layer-service/` base path will continue to function until
    Tue, 24 Mar 2026 05:00:00 GMT.


    Additionally, several endpoints are being deprecated. Endpoints that are being deprecated include additional properties in response headers:


    ```

    "Deprecation":  "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 23:59:59 GMT",

    "Link":         "New version of API link; rel=\"alternate\"",

    "Sunset":       "Tue, 24 Mar 2026 05:00:00 GMT"

    ```


    * `Deprecation`: The date and time when a resource will be deprecated. After this date, the resource may be removed from future versions of the API. 

    * `Link`: A link to a supported endpoint that replicates the functionality of a deprecated one, if one exists.

    * `Sunset`: The date and time when a resource will be removed, and no longer be available.


    ### Media Type Negotiation


    The API supports media type negotiation to determine the format of the response, based on the request's `Accept` header.


    Each endpoint with a non-empty response will have one or more specific media types that it supports - in addition to a generic media type (e.g. `application/json` for endpoints with JSON
    responses, and `text/csv` for endpoints with CSV responses)


    ##### Default Behavior


    - If no media type is specified, the API will default to the latest matching media type.

    - If a generic media type is specified, the API will return the latest response that matches that media type.

                          Potential mitigations include the following:\n  1. Omitting a break statement so that one may fall through is often indistinguishable from an error, and therefore should be
                          avoided. If you need to use fall-through capabilities, make sure that you have clearly documented this within the switch statement, and ensure that you have examined all the
                          logical possibilities.\n  2. The functionality of omitting a break statement could be clarified with an if statement. This method is much safer.

                              Potential mitigations include the following:\n  1. Omitting a break statement so that one may fall through is often indistinguishable from an error, and therefore should
                              be avoided. If you need to use fall-through capabilities, make sure that you have clearly documented this within the switch statement, and ensure that you have examined
                              all the logical possibilities.\n  2. The functionality of omitting a break statement could be clarified with an if statement. This method is much safer.

                              Potential mitigations include the following:
                                1. Omitting a break statement so that one may fall through is often indistinguishable from an error, and therefore should be avoided. If you need to use fall-through capabilities, make sure that you have clearly documented this within the switch statement, and ensure that you have examined all the logical possibilities.
                                2. The functionality of omitting a break statement could be clarified with an if statement. This method is much safer.

            The "Accept-Language" header field can be used by user agents to indicate the set of natural languages preferred in the response. This value must be compliant with [RFC
            7231](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7231.html#header.accept-language).


            A slight (but common) deviation from the HTTP specification is that if none of the requested languages can be satisfied, the application will default to English rather than rejecting the
            request with an HTTP 406 response code.


            If no language is provided, the application will default to English.


            English is currently the only supported language.

            This argument accepts a cursor to return the next (or previous) page of results, after (or before) _but not including_ the record with
            the provided cursor. It is similar to an offset for forward or backward pagination using a cursor. However you will never need to modify or synthesize a
            cursor value, they will always be provided from a prior response.

            If it's not set, depending on the direction of the pagination,
            the cursor will be positioned just before the beginning of the list (for forward pagination) or after the last record (for backward pagination).

            **Important:** The `_first` and `_last` parameters are mutually exclusive. You must use forward or backward pagination with each request, not both.

                              Potential mitigations include the following:
                                1. Omitting a break statement so that one may fall through is often indistinguishable from an error, and therefore should be avoided. If you need to use fall-through capabilities, make sure that you have clearly documented this within the switch statement, and ensure that you have examined all the logical possibilities.
                                2. The functionality of omitting a break statement could be clarified with an if statement. This method is much safer.

        **Important**: If you disable a property in a triage approval workflow for which there are pending approvals, an auto-approval job starts and pending approvals associated with the property you
        disabled are approved automatically. For example, when you disable fix-by dates in your organization's default approval workflow, an auto-approval job starts. All of the fix-by changes that
        are pending approval (in applications and projects that inherit your organization's triage approval workflow) are approved automatically.

      description: >
        Reset the triage approval workflow settings for your organization, an application, or a project.  When you reset your organization's workflow, all properties in the workflow are disabled. When
        you reset an application's workflow, the application will inherit your organization's workflow. When you reset a project's workflow, the project will inherit the application (if set) or
        organization-level workflow.
              
        **Important**: If a property in a triage approval workflow is disabled after reset, an auto-approval job starts and pending approvals associated with the disabled property are approved
        automatically. For example, if resetting disables fix-by dates in an application's approval workflow, an auto-approval job starts. All of the fix-by changes that are pending approval (in
        projects that inherit the application's triage approval workflow) are approved automatically.

        Get a list of Sigma and Coverity checkers run in SAST tests. 

        Use filter parameters to limit results to checkers used in tests run against a specific application, project, or branch, or limit results to checkers used in a specific SAST test.

        **Important:** If you request the checkers used in tests completed before the introduction of this endpoint, the call will return a 404. To avoid errors, retest your projects and branches
        before you call this endpoint.
