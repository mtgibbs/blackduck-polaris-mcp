    The Portfolio APIs retrieve and update information about Portfolios, Portfolio items (Applications), Portfolio Subitems (Projects), Branches and Tags.

      **Base path change and deprecation notice**

      The base path for the Portfolio service is changing (from `/api/portfolio` to `/api/portfolios`). The `/api/portfolio` base path will continue to function until `Tue, 24 Mar 2026 05:00:00 GMT`.

      Additionally, several endpoints are being deprecated. Endpoints that are being deprecated include additional properties in response headers:

      ```
        "Deprecation":  "Mon, 14 Jul 2025  23:59:59 GMT",
        "Link":         "New version of API link; rel=\"alternate\"",
        "Sunset":       "Tue, 24 Mar 2026 05:00:00 GMT"
      ```

      * `Deprecation`: The date and time when a resource will be deprecated. After this date, the resource may be removed from future versions of the API.
      * `Link`: A link to a supported endpoint that replicates the functionality of a deprecated one.
      * `Sunset`: The date and time when a resource will be removed, and no longer be available.

      `Note`: Media type names used in Polaris APIs were renamed and no longer include “synopsys”.
              Although media types that include “synopsys” were removed from the API specifications, existing endpoints will continue to support them until Tue, 24 Mar 2026 05:00:00 GMT.
              Please update your scripts to use the new media types.

                    A mapping of risk factors to risk categories for a specific application. The keys are the `id`s of the risk factors,
                    and the values are the `id`s of the risk categories. In this manner, an application could be configured with e.g.
                    `Business Criticality = Non-Critical, Network Exposure Level = Public Internet` (except instead of the names, the
                    `id`s would be used).

            Sorts subitems on the specified attributes. Default sorting method is `name` in `ascending` order. The format of the `_sort` parameter is
            `{field_name}|{asc|desc},{field_name}|{asc|desc},...`. Accepted values for sorting are `id`, `name`, `subItemType`, and `description`.

          * This API doesn't upload file-contents but returns a URL in `response.signedUrl` that can be used to upload the file-contents.

            * Use the **signedUrl** to perform a PUT operation and pass the file contents along.

        Creates an artifact for a portfolio item by portfolio item ID. This can be used to create the DAST Projects.

        **Note:**
          * This API doesn't upload file-contents but returns a URL in `response.signedUrl` that can be used to upload the file-contents.

            * Use the **signedUrl** to perform a PUT operation and pass the file contents along.
              Example below :
             ```
               curl -v --upload-file scan-settings.json \

                      A risk factor is an axis of measurement for applications which help determine an overall risk score. Example risk factors might include "Business Criticality" or "Network
                      Exposure Level". The specific values for each risk factor are defined via risk categories, specified in the `categories` array. During risk scoring, the risk factors for each
                      application are combined in a weighted average, with the result determining whether the "base" risk score of the application is increased or decreased.

                                A numerical representation of this risk category's value in its risk factor's axis.

                                A high value (10) represents an inflation of base risk scores; for example a business-critical application would
                                be rated with a 10 on the "Business Criticality" risk factor, putting a higher than average emphasis on the risk
                                of the application.

                                A low value (0) represents a deflation of base risk scores; for example an internal utility app would be rated with
                                a 0 on the "Business Criticality" risk factor, putting a lower than average emphasis on the risk of the application.

                                A value of 5 represents a neutral impact on the risk score.
                              example: 9
